# Robot Controller

The new Robot Controller board(s) will be responsible for replacing the XBox360 Controller currently used to control the rover. As it stands now, the current plans are to design 3 boards which will each control certain modules of the rover, and can be connected/disconnected at any time. A Dev Board has been created in order to test out different control components and see which are preferred. The MCU which will be on each board is the [STM32F446VET7](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f446re.pdf).
