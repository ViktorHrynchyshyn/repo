Capacitors:

Input:
 - Low ESR ceramic caps should be used at the input
 - Input caps place close to regulator pins
 - Check the input Cmin with the formula in the doc
 - 75mV is recommended max ripple
 - If reflected ripple is a concern, use an input inductor 

Output
 - Can't have toom much output capacitance or it will casue an overcurrent condition on start
 	- Should be in datasheet
 - If overall impedance is too low, the dynamic response of the regulator can be impacted
 - Self resonance frequency is the max usable freq for a cap
 - Low value ceramcic capacitrs are very good for fast transients and should be places near the 
   transient load
 - A capacitor network of multiple types is more effective in reducing impedance than just one type
   due to the specific freq band over which each is most effective
