Changes I made to the design (in calculations sheet):
 - Reduces the switching freq to get better overall performance
 - This changes a bunch of stuff, I'm sorry for doing this so late but I think our performance will improve
 -  Let me know if you have any question or disagreements

Changes To Make To Schematic:
 - Got down to one MOSFET
 - NO LONGER NEED AN LDO FOR VCCEXT
	- I made a bunch of changes to the design and now the IC power disspation looks fine wihtout it
 - Change RILIM and update current limit comment in schematic
 - Add in B82559B7103A027 as our new inductor
	- Make a note, we will need to have this part reviewed unless it uses a footprint that was already in the library
 - Change input and output caps
 	- Due to the reduced switching freq and inductor ripple current, our capacitance requiremnts have changes
	- Input capacitance needs to be 110uF now. Do this by replacing the 10uF caps with 5 of the 22uF caps being used at the output.
		- Do not removes the 1uF cap, it is for decoupling the input power
		- Using the same caps at the output and input is also good because it reduces part count and should save us money
	- Output capacitance need to be 110uF now. Do this by removing caps until there is only 5 22uF per channel plus the blank caps.
 - The loop compensation values have changes
	- You will need to change the resistor and capitor values for all of the loop compensation stuff
 	- Just use the next closest commone value for the resistors and capactors, don't try and find the exact value in the calculations sheet
	- I haven't double checked the loop compensation calculations yet but for sure the values have changed. May want to double check the calculations yourself if you haven't already

Other Notes: 
 - Need a heat sink for MOSFETs and IC (low priority task)
 - Route current sense and feedback lines first - keep them on the top layer
 - The 1uF cap in the input capacitor array needs to be placed close the the VIN pin on the IC. It is a decoupling cap.
