Changes To Make
 - Got down to one MOSFET
 - Find and LDO to drop 24V to 12-18V to supply VCCEXT in order to reduce switching loss
 - Change RILIM and update current limit comment in schematic
 - Select new inductor
 	- With inductance > 12uH
	- With saturation current > 21A (with a good margin)
	- With lowest available DCR (minimuze power loss in the inductor)
 - Need a heat sink for MOSFETs and IC (low priority task)
 - Route current sense and feedback lines first - keep them on the top layer
