Conflict Resolution
If you're updating a library or any binary file, and git tells you there is a conflict, please follow the following steps to resolve it:
1. Copy your local version somewhere else (ex. desktop).
2. Undo your changes.
3. Pull all the changes from the repository, overwriting your local copy.
4. Make your changes in the updated version of the file.
5. Commit and push your changes.

If you made a lot of changes, or you suspect someone else is working on the same file as you at the same time, then you can check the change log on github.com, the app, or the terminal (git log) to see who made the most recent changes to the file.
